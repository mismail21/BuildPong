Pong Game - This is a Python implementation of the classic Pong game. The game simulates the original two-player Pong arcade game, where players control paddles to hit a moving ball back and forth across the screen.

Features:
  Two-player gameplay: Both players can control paddles using different keys on the keyboard.
  Ball movement: The ball bounces off the paddles and screen edges, gaining speed with each bounce, providing increasing difficulty.
  Score tracking: The game keeps track of each player's score and displays it on the screen.
  Reset on miss: If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point, and the ball resets to the center.
Technologies Used:
  Python 3
  Turtle graphics: For rendering the game objects (paddles, ball, and score).
  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The code structure uses classes to handle game components such as the ball, paddles, and score.
How to Play:
  Player 1: Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to move the left paddle up and down.
  Player 2: Use the arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down.
  The first player to reach a certain score wins.
Future Improvements:
  Add sound effects for ball hits and scoring.
  Implement different difficulty levels or AI for a single-player mode.
